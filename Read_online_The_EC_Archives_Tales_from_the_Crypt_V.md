Overview
The EC line of comics shook up the 1950s, and the shocking audacity of their stories drew the scrutiny of Congress and the eventual creation of the Comics Code, effectively killing EC.
 
 But the stories live on, and EC Archives: Tales from the Crypt Volume 4 offers more infamous tales of fear, bloodshed, and the paranormal written by Al Feldstein and William Gaines and illustrated by Jack Davis, Graham Ingels, Jack Kamen, George Evans, Joe Orlando, and Marie Severin.
 
 This value-priced softcover collects Tales from the Crypt issues #35â€“#40, including the original stories, ads, text pieces, and letters. Foreword by eminent EC historian and publisher Russ Cochran.
